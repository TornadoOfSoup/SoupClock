This is a custom clock developed as a student project for use at a high school. Anyone who wants to use it should be aware that the remote email functionality will not work without replacing the credentials in MailCheckRunnable.java and recompiling the code, as the credentials currently listed in the code do not work. 

Key features:
  Several customizable parameters
  Festive themes for certain occasions
  Supports custom themes
  Optionally can display the day's schedule and highlight the current period
  Optionally can play animations at the end of periods in the schedule
  Optionally can display the time and date digitally
  Optional remote control via email

Note: If the credentials in MailCheckRunnable.java are updated, those credentials should not be pushed to Git, as it is a security risk. If this clock is to be used again, it would be good to update it such that it can pull those credentials from a configuration file.
